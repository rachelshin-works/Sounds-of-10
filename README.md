## Sounds of Ten

Inspired by the Eames studio's 1977 video "Powers of Ten," I expanded my Manhattan sound project into a series that pairs differently scaled images with pixel-generated sounds.

Using scales from 10⁻⁴ (0.0001) to 10⁵ (100,000), I created four distinct steps of 10s, each matched with unique pixel-sounds.
While I initially planned to align the oscillator settings, pixel counts, and slit speeds with powers of 10, the computational limitations made it impossible to work with very small or large numbers. So I scaled down each numbers noticeable like the table below.
